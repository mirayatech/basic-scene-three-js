## First three.js project ðŸŽˆ

By using three.js, I have been able to put together a simple red square (no bundler, no dependency, no modules, just an HTML file, and some JavaScript).

### What I've learned:
- the difference between WebGL & three.js
- how to load three.js
- how to create a scene, geometry, camera, ect.
- how to render the scene
